# Quest-VTT
**A CC BY 4.0 implementation of the Quest roleplaying system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop**

## What is this?
Quest-VTT is an implementation of The Adventure Guild's [Quest roleplaying system](https://adventure.game/) for Foundry Virtual Tabletop!

Our current release includes:
* Fill-in-the-blank character profiles with built-in d20 rolling (that posts annotated results to chat!)
* HP and Adventure Point trackers
* A sortable 12-slot inventory system
* A flexible Roles and Abilities system for your characters
* When paired with the upcoming compendium module (based on content from the [Quest Creators Resource](https://www.adventure.game/creators-license)),
    * _Limited descriptions_ for roles, learning paths, and abilities from the base game

Full descriptions and content from the Quest Game Book are **not included** (see the FAQ below for more details).  Please support The Adventure Guild and consider [purchasing a copy of Quest](https://www.adventure.game/digital-edition) if you like what you see!

## Creating custom compendiums
If you would like to create your own Foundry compendium for **personal use**, I would recommend doing the following:
1. Create your new compendiums. In order all Quest sheets to find your compendiums, please name them the following:
    - Abilities
    - Paths
    - Roles
2. Create your new ability.
3. Create your new path.
4. Create your new role.
5. Move each item to its appropriate compendium.
6. From the path compendium entry, add abilities to your path.
7. From the role compendium entry, add paths and legendary abilities to your role.

## FAQ
*   How do I load the Quest Creators Resource content in to my game?

   > I'll be making a compendium module available through Foundry VTT's [module list](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/modules) in the upcoming weeks.
*   Why the complicated system for creating new content?

   > I made the decision to allow for the creation of new content via non-coding means. By having the current, more complicated system for creating content, it means that anyone can create new content by using Foundry's _modules_ system.
*   Why are there no descriptions, effect roll ranges, or other content from the Quest Game Book?

   > Quest's [Creators License](https://www.adventure.game/creators-license) allows for the basic descriptions provided. If you wish to expand upon what is available for your own personal use, I would highly recommend supporting The Adventure Guild, and purchasing a copy of Quest from their [online store](https://www.adventure.game/store). As of August 2020, The Adventure Guild is currently sold out of physical books, but there's [digital edition](https://www.adventure.game/digital-edition) available in PDF.
